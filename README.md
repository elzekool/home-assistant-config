# Elze's Home Assistant Configuration
This is my Home Assistant configuration. The configuration is stored in GitHub for my own usage. 
Everybody is free to have a look at it but it is as-is without any support. Heck it may be even
completely broken.. so you are warned.

* Home Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi 3B
* RFXtrx433XL USB 433.92MHz Transceiver
